# **Machine Learning Software for Estimating Average Wind Speed ​​as a result of Air Pressure and Temperature Measurement (Unsupervised Learning - Cluster Method)**
I developed unsupervised learning machine learning software that works based on Air temperature and Air pressure data. In the project, data clustering and wind speed estimation are made visually. The most valuable aspect of the project is that there is a lot of data and the system works with high accuracy. The software I have created automatically brings you the estimation from the background data with the selection of columns and rows. See you in brand new projects!
The values you enter should be (respectively):

**1) Enter Air Pressure**

**2) Enter Air Temp**


_Example:_ `prediction_with_kmeans_cluster = k_means_clustering.predict([[air_pressure,air_temp]])
`

_Outpot :_ `Prediction Average Wind Speed: 1.2`

**I am happy to present this software to you!**
